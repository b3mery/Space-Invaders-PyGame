# Code Overview
* `main.py` is the entry point
* Level class is responsible for the orchestration and update of the sprites objects
* Player, Enemy and Bullet classes extend pygame.sprite.Sprite
    * These three could inherit from a more custom base class but do not due to time restraints.
* enemy_controller is a enemy orchestration class for drawing and moving the enemies to the screen as group. 
* `settings.py` contains constant game variables for controlling basic settings. 

## Running The Game:
Run `main.py` from the `src` folder. Ensure `src` is your current working directory as the imports are relative.
